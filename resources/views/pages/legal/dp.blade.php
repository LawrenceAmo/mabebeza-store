<p class="">
  A delivery is considered complete as soon as the parcel is accepted by you or an individual on your behalf at
your specified delivery address. Anyone who takes receipt of the parcel is presumed to be authorised to accept
delivery on your behalf. For verification purposes, the person accepting the parcel may be required to produceâ€‹
some form of identification (identity document/drivers licence/passport). Should nobody be present at the address
at the time of delivery, the parcel will remain with us. Our drivers will leave a notice at the delivery address to
indicate that there was an attempted delivery. You will be contacted to arrange an alternative delivery time.
Please note that we reserve the right to charge an additional delivery fee for a second attempt at delivery.
Delivery will then be effected for a second time at the indicated delivery time. If at that time there is no one
present at the address, the parcel will be returned to our warehouse and a return will be processed for the
products purchased. The delivery fee is non-refundable. You will be contacted in order to confirm the refund
method you would prefer.
</p>
<p class="">
  It is your responsibility to ensure that you or the intended receiver of the parcel inspect(s) the parcel on arrival
and makes known any complaints. The receiver has the right to refuse the parcel if it appears to have been
opened or if it has been damaged.
</p>
<p class="">
  Mabebeza Retailers charges a standard non-refundable delivery fee to deliver door-to-door and this fee will be
displayed when you view your cart before checkout. See FAQ for more information on deliveries.

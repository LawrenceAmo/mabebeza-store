          <p class="h3  text-purple"> Delivery Fee</p>
          Mabebeza Retailers charges a standard non-refundable delivery fee of
          R35 for door-to-door delivery within the areas that we deliver to. The
          delivery fee will be displayed in your cart before checkout.

          <p class="h3  text-purple">Delivery T’c & C’s</p>
          
          <p>A delivery is considered complete as soon as the parcel is accepted by you or an individual on your behalf at your specified delivery address. Anyone who takes receipt of the parcel is presumed to be authorized to accept delivery on your behalf.</p>
  
          <p>For verification purposes, the person accepting the parcel may be required to produce some form of identification (identity document, driver's license, passport).</p>
  
          <p>If no one is present at the address during the time of delivery, the parcel will remain with us. Our drivers will leave a notice at the delivery address to indicate the attempted delivery. You will be contacted to arrange an alternative delivery time.</p>
  
          <p>Please note that we reserve the right to charge an additional delivery fee for a second delivery attempt. The delivery will be attempted again at the indicated delivery time.</p>
  
          <p>If there is no one present at the address during the second delivery attempt, the parcel will be returned to our warehouse, and a return will be processed for the purchased products. The delivery fee is non-refundable. You will be contacted to confirm your preferred refund method.</p>
  
          <p class="h3  text-purple">Inspection and Complaints</p>
          <p>It is your responsibility to ensure that you or the intended receiver of the parcel inspect the parcel upon arrival and report any complaints. The receiver has the right to refuse the parcel if it appears to have been opened or if it has been damaged.</p>
